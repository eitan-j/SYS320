1. What has been your experience learning bash?

Prior to taking this class, I've been using Manjaro as my desktop OS for about a semester. Manjaro uses zsh by default, which acts the same as bash for simple commands. Prior to this class, I made a few very simple bash scripts.
Learning bash has been fairly intuitive. For example, bash has no variable "types"; everything is a string. That being said, bash does also have a some weirdness with syntax and other stuff.


2. What would have made the experience with learning it better, if there were problems with it, my instructions, or the assignments?

There are some things in bash that were not covered much that I think is important. Parameter expansion is useful and I didn't see it. I also think more focus should have been put on quotes, especially double quotes, since omitting them can causes weird issues that only appear in edge cases.
Also, egrep is depricated. grep -E should be used instead, but that doesn't really make a difference.

3. Approximately how much time did you spend working on assignments?

Around 1 hour of watching the lectures and 1-3 hours of work.

4. Are you able to see how the programs used in this class or learning bash would be helpful for your career? 
Yes.
